		<h2>Purpose</h2>
		<p>The purpose of this site is to practice HTML, directory structures, documentation, and deployment. I do not wish to have a "personal website" after this assignment is completed.</p>
		<p>The audience for this is my instructors.</p>
		<h2>These are my goals:</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>To acquire full employment with a salary and benefits, beginning 7/1/16 or later. I am not open to contract work, as I'm a WIOA recipient.</li>
			<li>To showcase my work on LinkedIn and github.</li>
			<li>(For the record, until this class I had a very low digital profile, and I do not wish to have anything more public than my Twitter, LinkedIn, and github accounts.)</li>
		</ul>
		<h2>Persona</h2>
			<p>My instructors need to check my work and grade me. They are probably frustrated because I don't want a personal website. :)</p>
		<h2>Use Case</h2>
			<p>On the morning of Tuesday, April 19, my instructor Rochelle will use her Windows laptop to access this work over the STEMulus center's wireless network. Her goal is to evaluate my work.</p>
