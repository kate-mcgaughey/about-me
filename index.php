		<h1>My Name is Kate McGaughey</h1>
		<p>For the last eight years I have lived in Santa Fe, an outdoorsman's paradise. I just moved to Albuquerque to attend the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. When I graduate on June 17, 2016, I will be seeking work as a full-stack web developer, and this website will have been replaced. Please don't check back. :)</p>
		<h2>Some of my favorite things</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Skiing</li>
				<li>Mountain biking</li>
				<li>Rock climbing</li>
				<li>Backpacking</li>
				<li>Dogs</li>
				<li>Craft beer</li>
				<li>Current events and journalism</li>
				<li>Battlestar Galactica</li>
			</ul>

		<p>This is my dog Annie, who I think is a golden retriever/border collie mix. She's so smart and adventurous!</p>
		<img src="media/leila.jpg" alt="My cat"/>
		<p>This is my cat Leila. Don't be confused if she looks like a dog. She's afraid of water, demands constant affection, and she lacks for intelligence compared to the dog. Hence, she's a cat.</p>
