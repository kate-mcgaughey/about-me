		<h1>My Name is Kate McGaughey</h1>
		<p>For the last eight years I have lived in Santa Fe, an outdoorsman's paradise. I just moved to Albuquerque to attend the Deep Dive Coding Bootcamp. When I graduate on June 17, 2016, I will be seeking work as a full-stack web developer, and this website will have been replaced. Please don't check back. :)</p>
		<h2>Some of my favorite things</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>Skiing</li>
				<li>Mountain biking</li>
				<li>Rock climbing</li>
				<li>Backpacking</li>
				<li>Dogs</li>
				<li>Craft beer</li>
				<li>Current events and journalism</li>
				<li>Battlestar Galactica</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Some other skillfull things I wouldn't put on a resume:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An ear for music - figuring out songs on my guitar from the recording and knowledge of basic song structure.</li>
				<li>Map-reading guru, on or off trail.</li>
				<li>Small trunk? I'm a boss at packing lots of awkwardly-sized objects into small spaces.</li>
				<li>In case of a viral pandemic, I've got us covered.</li>
				<li>I am very good at reacting to ugly babies.</li>
				<li>Due to an anatomical anomaly, if I wanted to learn circular breathing, I could sqirt milk out my tear ducts like that guy on Ripley's Believe it or Not. I would really rather not invest the time...</li>
				<li>I still remember a 3-page poem I had to memorize in the 4th grade.</li>
				<li>Hitchhiked through Tasmania with no protection but a Leatherman. If you had asked my mother to draw you a picture of the kind of driver I should <i>not</I> get in a truck with, I got in a truck with that guy. He was cool though. He bought my friend and I orange juice and cookies.</li>
			</ul>

		<p>This is my dog Annie, who I think is a golden retriever/border collie mix. She's so smart and adventurous!</p>
		<img src="media/leila.jpg" alt="My cat"/>
		<p>This is my cat Leila. Don't be confused if she looks like a dog. She's afraid of water, demands constant affection, and sits down on top of others. Hence, she's a cat.</p>
